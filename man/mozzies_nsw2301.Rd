\description{
This dataset is derived from the
\href{https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/mosquito-borne/Pages/surveillance.aspx}{NSW Arbovirus Surveillance and Mosquito Monitoring program}.
The program monitors mosquito-borne diseases in the state of New South Wales,
Australia. A number of mosquito traps are managed by the program during the
spring to autumn months when mosquitoes are active.
}
\details{
Each week traps are collected and the mosquito species are identified and
counted. This is analysed alongside climate conditions, and arbovirus
detections in the traps to inform public health management of human disease
risk from arboviruses in NSW. This dataset includes the mosquito abundance
tables for January 2023. Additional context and analysis can be found in the
original report published by NSW Health.

The trap locations are classified as inland or coastal (since the species
found will depend on the environmental conditions). A separate group of sites
are labelled as being in the Sydney region (i.e. with the highest human
population density).

The counts are binned with the following definition:
\describe{
\item{\code{NA}}{No observation}
\item{low}{< 50}
\item{medium}{50 - 100}
\item{high}{101 - 1,000}
\item{very high}{1,001 - 10,000}
\item{extreme}{> 10,000}
